************************

This is the base code released on 25th May 2025, as part of the ongoing ROBOSOCCER workshop at IIT Madras.
This is meant to be a baseline for creating Raspberry Pi Pico W, ESP8266 and ESP32S3 based robots.
Participants are free to use this code for non-commercial purposes only and are encouraged to modify it and create macros, multiple moves coded into a single button and so on. Please remember the GNU GPL v3.0 license requires attribution and also requires you to share derivative works after the competition is over.

I wish to thank Dr.Janakiraman Viraraghavan our chief mentor at IIT Madras, for his support and enthusiasm without which this robotics project will not have been successful.
